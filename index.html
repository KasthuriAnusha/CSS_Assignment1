    <h2><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol>
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
<li><font>Css is not neccesary</font><span>CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
<li id="uline">External stylessheets are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
</ol>
    <h2><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: </i></h2>
<ul>
<li style="letter-spacing: 6px;">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
<li class="lsp">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li class="lsp">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
<li class="lsp">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span>in this tutorial we will use inline and and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID. on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elemens to which a style should be applied.</p><br>
